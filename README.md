# Perceptron Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Motivation
I'm building this project because I'm really interested in learning about artificial neural networks and how they work. This project is just the beginning of my journey in this field. I'm excited to explore more about how our brains work and also how the human neural system functions. My goal is to understand how neural networks can mimic some of these processes and potentially contribute to advancements in fields like medicine. Specifically, I'm passionate about exploring applications in understanding and addressing neurological disorders like ALS. By starting with the Perceptron algorithm, I hope to learn the basics and eventually dive deeper into studying neural networks and their potential role in medical res
